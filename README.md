## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is a Redux project. It uses the redux store to manage states that are needed in the app. Having multiple states, `redux-toolkit` was used to manage the state, read its value and dispatch the actions needed in the components that are subscribed to the store through `useSelector`.
